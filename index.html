      <p class="art">Josh Collins had never been to New York before last summer. His first trip to the city, on his 22nd birthday, was for a job interview at a software company.

Mr. Collins was eager to move. Fresh from the University of Alabama with a computer science degree, he figured the time was right. He had no commitments, no debts — and no connections, either. As he returned to the airport after his interview, he got a call offering him the job, and he took it.

During his brief visit, “the city lived up to my expectations and then some,” said Mr. Collins, who is from Knoxville, Tenn. “I had never seen so many people in one place, all moving. It was super eye-opening and awesome. I had never had a bagel with cream cheese. I ate my way through Midtown.”

Mr. Collins had just over a month to line up an apartment, with some relocation help from his new employer. He had no nearby friends or family to stay with. His budget for a rental, which he would share with his dog, Katara, was in the low $2,000s.

Many dog-friendly buildings had restrictions. Katara weighs around 35 pounds, over the limit in some cases. “She is not a small puppy, and you can’t carry her in a purse, which is mainly what places allowed,” he said.

After searching online listings, he found a nice studio, small but with a view, in a dog-friendly Midtown West high-rise condo near 10th Avenue. The owner was subletting it for $2,100 a month.</p>

  “I negotiated a rider that stated the owner acknowledged it was fine for me to have a dog, and if the apartment complex decided I had to leave because of her, he would allow me out of my lease,” Mr. Collins said.

The building permitted dogs for owners — but not for someone subletting. But the agent told him it was just a formality. If need be, the owner would claim that Mr. Collins was merely dog-sitting.

The situation felt shady. “It is not something I wanted to do under the radar,” he said.

He got his deposit back and started the hunt anew. “That was kind of a hard hit,” he said. “My family and I were way over our heads in how this process works.”

A new listing led him to Susan McGettigan, a licensed saleswoman at Citi Habitats. “She was super-frank, which I loved,” Mr. Collins said. “I knew she was not trying to sell me a place; she was trying to find me a home.”

With time running short and much of his relocation budget already consumed, Mr. Collins made a second house-hunting trip north. “I was kind of terrified,” he said. “Because of getting hosed with the first agent, I was cautious that I could not take anything at face value. I want to understand every little detail about what I am doing.”

His research included neighborhood video tours on YouTube. “That was really helpful, because I was getting insight into the kind of lifestyle you can expect,” he said. “It became a really good tool that I used a lot to figure out what neighborhood I wanted.”

  He was inclined toward the East Village, he said, as it had “more of a younger culture, which was a cool thing for me because I am going to be 22 in the city.”

  Ms. McGettigan led him around for two days. “I thought the East Village might be the best fit, but I wanted to give him a kind of smorgasbord tour,” she said. They started in Midtown West and headed south and east.

  An early favorite was a Chelsea one-bedroom directly adjacent to the High Line. Mr. Collins didn’t even mind that passers-by could peer in. “I could get curtains,” he said. But he did mind that the apartment was on the fourth floor, with no elevator.

  In the East Village, a renovated second-floor studio with exposed brick was another favorite. “It didn’t have anything bad with it,” Mr. Collins said. Like many of the places he saw, it was small but clean.
